# Newton-Fractal
This Project in C++ will create a Newton Fractal image, which shows where to estimate the root of the function, and points where it will be impossible to estimate the root using Newton's method.

The Newton1.ppm, Newton2.ppm, and Newton3.ppm are the outputs of the project when running in the original state. You can see the picture version of it using GIMP
