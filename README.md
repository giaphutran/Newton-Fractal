# Newton-Fractal

## Overview
This Project in C++ will create a Newton Fractal image, which shows where to estimate the root of the function, and points where it will be impossible to estimate the root using Newton's method. The function that is originally represented here is f(z)=z^3-2z+2

The Newton1.ppm, Newton2.ppm, and Newton3.ppm are the outputs of the project when running in the original state. You can see the picture version of it using GIMP

Because Newton1.ppm and Newton2.ppm are >25MB, I cannot upload it here, but Newton3.ppm will do a good job representing the Newton Fractal Image of the function

## Usage
### Changing the function getting estimated
``` cplusplus
cout<<"Hello World">>;
```
